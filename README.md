# Battery_Cooling_Model
In this model, we are calculating the required mass flow rate of coolant (air, water, etc.) and cooling power needed to effectively cool the battery.
By analyzing Nissan Leaf data, we determined that the peak battery temperature reaches 20.050Â°C. This temperature is within acceptable limits, and therefore, no additional coolant is necessary to cool the battery.
